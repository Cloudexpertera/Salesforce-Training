Q)What is database?
	Which is used to store the data and retrive the data.

Q)Why do we need database?
	To store day to day transcation

Q)Which companies use database?
	Almost all the industries use the database to store the data.

So transfer day to day transactions what is the database used?
	Online Transcation Processing (OLTP)
  
For example : 

Flipkart : To store order details

Banks : To store customers data

Q)What is the source for OLTP databse?

	Banks -----> 1.Data for transcation application
		     2.Personal Loans
		     3.Car loans
		     4.Mutual Funds...etc

So the data that is coming from different application is the source for OLTP database.

So applications is the source for OLTP.

Now a days most of all the companies are maintaining two types of databases.
	1.OLTP
	2.OLAP or Data Ware House or Decision Support System

Q)Why companies maintain OLAP?
	for analysis

So
	OLTP	: for storing day to day transcations	/ For Running the business
	OLAP	: for analyzing the business		/ To analyze the business

Q)Why can't we use OLTP database for Analysis?
	For analyzing the business i need historical data

Ex: I want to know the best Cricket Player: With today's data I cannot decide who is the best player right.
    I need hostoric data then only I can find the best player

So If I store the Historical data and day to day transcation data in a single database, then definelty it 
will effect performance issue.

Q)What is the source for OLAP?
     OLTP

The data is moved from OLTP to OLAP according to the business requirment ( 1month/3months/6months..etc)

So the process of moving the data from OLTP to OLAP database is known as ETL mechanisam.

ETL :Extract-Transform-Load

Extracting the Data from OLTP ========> Transform the Data =======> load the data into OLAP

Q)What is Transforming the data means?
	
For ex: OLTP is storing the data in the detailed Information
	OLAP requires only the summarized data for analyzing

Q)So now the data needs to be transformed ?

For Example : OLTP stores the date in the form of DD/MM/YYYY
	      OLAP stores the data in the form of YYYY/MM/DD

So now the data needs to be transformed?

Q)How can we transform this data?
	Informatica
	Talender.....etc
	

After loading the data we analyze the data 
	
Q)How do we analyze the data?
	OBI (Oracle Business Intelligence)
	Qlick View
	Tableau......etc

But in Salesforce

for Transforming we use:

		1.Data Import wizard
		2.Data Loader
		3.Data Loader.io
		4.Workbench.......etc

for Analyzing we use
		1.Reports 
		2.Dashboards

======================================********************************======================================
					Data Management
					------*--------
Q):What is data management?
	Extracting the data or pulling the data from an external envinorment or from an external source into 
salesforce or viceversa.

External source:Oracle database,SQLdatabase..etc,.

External media: Excel sheet,Pen drive,Flopy disk..etc,.

The above data mangement concept can be achived by using Three tools.
		i.Data Import Wizard (DIW)
		ii.Data Loader (DL)
		iii.Data Loader.Input/Output (DL.io)

Q)What is the difference between Export and Export all?

Export : It means salesforce will extract data the data only the records that are available on the respective
	 objects

Export all : It means salesforce will extract the data from the respective objects and the data that is
	      available in the recycle bin.

Q)What is the difference between Delete and Hard delete?

Delete : It will remove the records from the object and stores the records in the recycle bin

Hard delete : It will permenantly delete records from the object (not even in the recycle bin also).

Q) What is Upsert operation in Dataloader
Upsert = Update + insert

First check the id of the records if availble, then update, if not, then create the record in the salesforce

					 Reports and Dashboards (OLAP)
					    ----------*-----------
Report: 
------
   i)It is a collection of information and an organized presentation of data  about a particular object
(or with its related objects) under certain criteria.

(or)

  ii)It is the Pictorial representation of raw data that exist in the organization to understand the business
process done by the top level management.

Navigation steps:
-----------------
Goto App launcher 
  |
   --->Select the respective app
	  |
	  ---> Click on Reports Tab
                  

Standard Report types:
	
1.They comeup with the org				1.You have no control on the default fields 
							  selected on the reports
2.New custom fields are automatically added to 		2.You have no control on over what fields are 
any report using the object.				  available to use.

Note: Whenever we create an object we have an option to select "Allow Reports" which means we can use this
report for standard report type. It doesn't mean that we cannot create reports on that object.

On the reports section you will find 2 things
	1.New Report
	2.New Report (Salesforce Classic)

Note : 
1.When there is a lookup relationship between the objects the child object is the primary report object.

2.When there is a master detail relationship between the objects the parent object is the primary
report object.


Create two objects

1.Lookup object in realtionship with opportunity

2.Master detail object in relationship with opportunity

Note : Access to reports and dashboards is totally dependent on the folder they reside in.
Note : You can make any of report as favourite

We can share the report from the folder
 
Goto the respective Report
   |
   ---->Add the report to the folder and save
	    |
	    ---> Click on the dropdown on the report folder
                     |
		     ----> Select share
				 |
				  ----> You have an ability to share the report to the user in 4 ways

1.Users

2.Roles

3.Roles and sub-ordinates

4.Public Groups

with 

1.Can view : They have an ability to view Reports and dashboards

2.Can Edit : They can edit and create a report to the folder.They can rename the report and dashboard in 
the folder and delete the report and dashboard from the folder.


3.Manage : which means they can share the folder to other individuals, they can remove the access,edit and 
delete the reports and dashboards from the folders. 

Custom Report types:
-------------------
Pros:
----
1.you determine the objects in the report.

2.You decide what fields and sections are in the field pane.

3.you decide the default fields used in the report.

Cons:
-----
1.new custom fields are not automatically added to any reports using the object

Q)How to create custom report types in salesforce?
A) Setup
   |
   ---->Quick find
	    |
	    ---> Feature setting
                     |
		     ----> Analytics
				 |
				 ----> Reports and Dashboards
						|
						---> Report types
							|
				 			----> Continue
								|
								---> New custom Report type
									|
									---> Fill the respective info
Primary object : Name of the object
Report type Lable :(C) Name of the report
Report type Name : API Name
Store in Catogery : Select the respective catogery
Deployment : Deployed
	|
	--->Next
	     |
	     --->Save

Now we find the default fields that we want in the report generation(Edit field properties)
		|
		---> Select the respective fields
			|
			----> Click on Edit properties
					|
					----> Click on Checked by default

Note : If you want to create a New section for certain fields we can 

	Goto create New section
		|
		----> Give the name of the file
				|
				 ----> Drag and drop the required fields
						|
						----> Save

Scenario1: Create a New report on the opportunity object of custom report type.
		Group by Stage

Note : Reports tell us the story and dadhboard puts the picture to the story.

Dashboard : Collection of Reports is known as Dashboard.
---------

Different types of dashboards:
-----------------------------
1.Horizantal Chart : Good for showing distance or time differences. Generally used for one grouping

2.Vertical Chart : Similar to Horizantal Chart

3.Line Chart : Good for showing week to week,Quater to quarter. Generally used for one grouping

4.Pie Chart: Grouping mutliple fields

5.Donut chart : Grouping mutliple fields

6.Funnel Chart : Grouping mutliple fields

7.Scatter chart :Grouping mutliple fields

8.Guage Chart: Probability. One grouping

9.Martix :  One grouping

Create the dasboard:
